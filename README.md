# README-Generator

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## Key Points
1. Prompts for user input using inquirer.
2. User input is used to create the following components: Title, Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
3. Upon completion, a new README file is generated using the previous components.
